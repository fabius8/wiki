 >Wei Xie  
can you try command of  
" **`ethswctl -c hw-switching -o disable`** " 

* Loopback 命令 ethswctl

```
bit14:
14 INTERNAL_LOOPBACK R/W Enable GMII Internal loopback.
1'b1 = Enable GMII Loopback. Packets received on the GMII receive input pins will be loopback out the GMII transmit output pins.
1'b0 = Normal operation.
Note: For 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps modes, FORCE_LINK must be set (RDB_REG, offset 0x00E, bit[12] = 1'1).

  you can use ethctl command to set it
read it
# ethctl eth1 reg 0
mii (phy addr 0xf008) register 0 is 0x1140

then set it the loopback
# ethctl eth1 reg 0 0x5140
mii (phy addr 0xf008) register 0 is 0x5140
# ethctl eth1 reg 0 0x5140eth1 (Ext switch port: 0) (Logical Port: 8) Link UP 0 mbps half duplex

 >You can use below command.  
\# ethswctl -c pause  
Port(-p) should be specified  
&emsp;    `ethswctl {-c|--command} pause [-n <unit>] -p <port> -v val`  
&emsp;&emsp;          val = 0-None, 1-Auto, 2-Both, 3-Tx only, 4-Rx only  
// Ex, enable pause on switch port 2  
\# ethswctl -c pause -p 2 -v 2  
Success  
\# ethswctl -c pause -p 2  
The val8 = 2  
Both Tx and Rx Pause Enabled  
Success
